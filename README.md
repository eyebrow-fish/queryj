# QueryJ

A simple REST tool created in JavaFX to replace heavier tools like Insomnia and Postman.
I believe a desktop application that is built for purpose makes a lot more sense sometimes.

# Usage

QueryJ is currently underdevelopment, so the setup of QueryJ is entirely up to user.
As it stands, the way I use it while developing it is through IntelliJ or Maven via this command:

>$ mvn clean javafx
