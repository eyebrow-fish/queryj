# QueryJ

A simple REST tool created in JavaFX to replace heavier tools like Insomnia and Postman. I believe a desktop application
that is built for purpose makes a lot more sense sometimes.

I wrote another prototype of this in Scala and Swing, and I liked working on that as well. I just couldn't see a huge
advantage for my use case, so the technologies I chose here stuck.
